To build, go to bens_build/
	cmake ../ -DMFEM_USE_MPI=YES -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./
should detect hypre, blas, etc., automatically
	make
	make install
installs in bens_build

To make examples, need to modify makefile in examples folder so that build directory is bens_build/, then copy bens_build/config/* to config/.
This includes default.mk files that are appropriate for my laptop.
